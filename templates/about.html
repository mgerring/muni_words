Talk of the Town is a fun experiment built by Andrew Pendleton, Kaitlin Lee and Matthew Gerring of the <a href="http://sunlightlabs.com">Sunlight Labs</a> for the 2011 Labs Olympics. Talk of the Town pulls in data from the <a href="http://granicus.com">Granicus</a> API and calculates the frequency and geographical distribution of different words and phrases. Users can search for a particular word and zoom around the map to see their frequency. The data is from the past 6 months, as of 9/1/2011.

Talk of the Town is not meant to be an exhaustive tool for analysis. It's corpus doesn't cover everywhere in America, but it's a big enough sample to be fun! Send feedback to talkofthetown[AT]sunlightfoundation[DOT]com.
